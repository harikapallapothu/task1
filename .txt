2) How does a browser render a web page?
A.  Initially, the browser reads the HTML text and converts it into DOM tree and later into CSSOM tree. Then a render tree is created and the printing of the page will start. 
 Now, the layouting process will start. Based on the details given in the render tree, the size, color and all the layout will be created. Now the painting process starts where 
 the layers will be created and in each layer required data will be printed and this process is called rasterization. Now to finally print it on the screen Composting process is done. 
 The actual process of rendering is DOM contruction followed by CSSOM construction then render tree construction followed by layouting then painting and finally composting.
